      <h3>BOHOL READY TO WELCOME BACK TOURISTS</h3>
      <p>
        Cebu City, Philippines — Bohol is now ready to reopen and welcome tourists back to
        its shores.
      </p>
      <p>
        The announcement came during a digital conference with members of the press as the
        province, together with tourism stakeholders launched the “Balik sa Bohol: Bohol
        Online Sale” an online sale where hotels, resorts, and tour operators offer massive
        price drops to lure tourists back to the island province.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bohol Governor Arthur Yap explained that the province has long been ready for the
        return of tourists back to the island as health and safety protocols have been
        modified to fit the needs of tourists in co-relation to the guidelines set by the
        COVID-19 Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases
        (IATF).
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Yap, with the success of the Philippine Travel Exchange (PHITEX) in
        September; and the Philippine Tourism Destination Inventory and MICE+E Bohol
        Familiarization Trip both held in the island in December, the two events served
        as thrust as they open their shores to tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Panglao Mayor Leonila Montelo said that Bohol’s premier tourist destination suffered
        huge losses during the lockdown that turned the once-bustling island into a “ghost
        town”. <a href='https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/362975/bohol-ready-to-welcome-back-tourists'>Source</a>.

      <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE "NEW NORMAL" IN BOHOL?</h3>
      <p>
        PANGLAO, Bohol -- The island province of Bohol is gearing up to finally welcome
        leisure tourists starting December 15, 2020 including those from areas under
        general community quarantine (GCQ) areas like Metro Manila.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bohol Governor Arthur Yap confirmed that they will be accepting frequent independent
        travelers of all ages, including senior citizens and minors, in a bid to jumpstart the
        local economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat welcomed the development of easing age
        restrictions for travel, saying that Christmas is just around the corner and that
        Filipinos really travel together as a family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tour operators and members of the media got to experience first-hand the steps the
        provincial government of Bohol is taking to fight COVID-19 while cautiously reopening
        the island to tourists.
      </p>

      <h3>BOHOL SCRAPS QUARANTINE PROCEDURES FOR ARRIVING TOURISTS</h3>
      <p>
        THE province of Bohol has eased up on some of its protocols meant
        to contain the spread of Covid-19, in a bid to inject life into its
        moribund tourism industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For one, tourists are not required to quarantine for five to 14 days
        upon arrival.  In an online news briefing for the Balik sa Bohol online
        sale, Bohol Gov. Arthur Yap added, tourists only have to present a
        “negative RT-PCR test result, with the swab taken within 72 hours to
        travel time; confirmed booking at a Department of Tourism (DOT)-accredited
        hotel, and must register at http://tourism.bohol.gov.ph. For those going on
        tour, a confirmed tour booking through a DOT-accredited tour operator.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He also said, the province is now accepting RT-PCR saliva testing to lower
        travel costs and encourage more tourists to visit, “and we have devised a
        ‘bubble tourism’ system to allow greater flexibility for travel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        While Panglao Island and the municipality of Anda are the only areas officially
        open for domestic tourism, Yap explained the “bubble tourism” concept will
        still allow tourists to “visit attractions along the way even if municipalities
        are not officially open.” Such itineraries will have to be booked through
        accredited tour operators enumerated on the Bohol province portal.
